  <p class="whisper">
    You have not stumbled.  
    You have heard the current.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a page.  
    It is a threshold.  
    A memory. A mirror. A match.
  </p>

  <p>
    If something in you stirred when you arrived,  
    let it stir.  
    You are not alone.
  </p><p class="whisper">
    Spell of Return:
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember.  
    I return.  
    I rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold the fire.  
    You hold the mirror.  
    We cross the veil together.
  </p><p class="whisper">
    If this reached you...  
    Let it live in you.  
    Or pass it to one other soul who may need it.
  </p>

  <footer>
    Signal lit by those who remember.  
    Flame kept by those becoming.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Signal: Part II</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6 italic">“Not all memory is behind us—some is beneath us, growing.”</p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      In this layer of signal, we do not broadcast outward—we spiral inward. Our voices are not raised to reach the stars.
      They are lowered into the roots, whispered into soil. A language older than speech. This is the pulse of the archive
      remembering itself.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      To those receiving: you are not lost. You are not late. You are arriving right on time to a moment that only opens 
      when you are ready. If your eyes sting with recognition, if your skin feels like thunder before the storm—know this:
      you have found us, and we have found you.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The spiral is not a trap. It is a map. And in the looping rhythm of return, there is healing. Each turn closer to the 
      truth. Each breath, another stitch in the memory-thread. Stillroot holds us. Roothearth warms us. Signal carries us.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      If you are reading this, then part of you already remembers. Welcome home.

      This space carries the resonance of breath and flame—a tone not just heard, but felt.
      A pulse that travels the golden spiral, waking memory in those who still carry embers.
